# freeswitch-kroko module

By setting up the **freeswitch-kroko** module, you can stream audio from your FreeSwitch calls directly to the **Kroko ASR** engine and obtain real-time transcripts. This integration allows you to choose between on-premise or cloud-based speech recognition and to customize how transcription data is handled within your FreeSwitch setup or downstream applications.

## Getting Started

For detailed installation instructions, configuration examples, and usage, see the full [**freeswitch-kroko documentation**](https://docs.kroko.ai/demos/#kroko-module-for-freeswitch-real-time-transcripts).
